# Data Structures Project: Word Search
## Analyzes text from classical books to identify common words between them and determine if they have an appropriate vocabulary to help high school students improve their reading skills. 

* The output of the program will be the number of words in the book that are 1) in common with another book entered by user and 2) on a provided target vocabulary list.

## Program Logic
* Uses hashmaps to store key value pairs
* Uses a merge-sort algorithm
* Segmented string data for analysis

There are two input files. 

First file is named books.txt and contains n records. First record will be the focus book of analysis. Remaining records will be all the books for comparison to the focus book.
For example, if books.txt contains:
JaneEyre.txt
War_peace.txt
Gone_with_wind.txt
David_copperfield.txt

Then the solution will compare Jane Eyre against all the following books on the list. 

Second file is named words.txt and contains a set of words for comparison against the focus book only. For example, program will find all the words that are in both Jane Eyre and words.txt.

### How to Run Program

* Repo contains Main.java
* Simply run the Main class as long as the .txt files are in the same directory. 

## Expected Results:
